                  <h2>Tech <br />Everywhere</h2>

                  <p>What motivated me to pursue this project is changing how people interact with their technology. Too much time is spent on trying to work the technology instead of letting the technology work for you.</p>

                  <p>The problem with technology nowadays is that we pay too much attention to it. It’s upsetting how devoted people are to their electronics like they’re in a monogamous relationship with it.</p>

                  <p>I want people to stop constantly looking at their technology. Because of this, technology is often in the way of productivity and efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Modern technology has the potential to know when it is needed and when to make itself be available for use. If technology can do that, it should be able to help us with everyday things in ways that it has never been imagined to do.</p>

It talks to other methods of technology. It knows when you need to wake up. It knows when you need to do things and alerts you.</p>

                  <p>Its a familiar object used in many different ways. It’s meant to be simple yet elegant with an interesting cut. The style is low-poly and works with the minimalist trend in design.</p>

                  <p>It doesn’t need batteries thus it will never need to be charged. Instead, it is powered through contact with your skin. Upon making contact, it automatically syncs up with other forms of technology.</p>

                  <p>It will be made up of metals and colorful polycarbonates. It harkens to the familiar, classical form of the watch yet has the capabilities of modern technology. Also worn on the wrist, it is equal in function as the other two.</p>

                  <p>Technology has evolved to a point where interaction takes place in more than just a screen. Rather, it interacts with us.</p>

                  <p>The IBM 5100 is based on a 16-bit processor module called PALM (Put All Logic in Microcode). The IBM 5100 Maintenance Information Manual also referred to the PALM module
as the controller. The PALM could directly address 64 KB of memory. Some configurations of the IBM 5100 had Executable ROS (ROM) and RAM memory totalling more than 64 KB, so a simple bank switching scheme was used.</p>
<p>The IBM 5100 is one of the first “portable” computers. It was the evolution of a prototype called the SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) that was developed
at the IBM Palo Alto Scientific Center.</p>

<p>This was a milestone in technology, being portable and addressing two kinds of languages (APL, BASIC) and being based off a problem solver library it was able to compute things with more then a 1000 time interaction which was a marked 20% faster then competing tech.</p>

                <p>Aside from larger screen size and performance benefits over its predecessor, the IBM 5120 design incorporated several usability advantages such as a reduced ‘footprint’, ease of handling/lifting based on bottom form treatment.</p>
                <p>Due to these enhancements in usability the IBM 5120 was recognized
with two major industrial design awards and described with terms such as “clean, well thought out”; “subtle detailing shows great care in execution”; and “looks like quality”.</p>

                  <p>The Lisa is a personal computer designed by Apple Computer, Inc. during the
early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface in an inexpensive machine aimed at individual business users.</p>
                  <p>The Lisa was a more advanced system than the Macintosh of this time in many respects, such as its inclusion of protected memory, preemptive multitasking, a generally more sophisticated hard disk based operating system, a built-in screensaver, an advanced calculator with a paper
tape and RPN, support for up to 2 megabytes (MB) of RAM, expansion
slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection schemes such as block sparing, non-physical file names
(with the ability to have multiple documents with the same name), and
a larger higher-resolution display.</p>
                  <p>The Lisa was a major step in creating the macintoshs of the 80’s, Due to it’s GUI it was a milestone in computing that is still apart of today’s tech.</p>

                  <p>These machines caused a stir in the industry with their compact dark grey cases, use of a trackball, and the clever positioning of the keyboard which left room for palmrests on either side of the pointing device. Portable PC computers at the time tended to have the keyboard forward towards the user, with empty space behind it, so this was a surprising innovation and set the standard layout all future notebook computers would follow.</p>

                  <p>It was criticized for abandoning then- current technological standards like the
Apple Desktop Bus connector in favor of the emerging USB standard, which at the time was seen as detrimental but it was because of this computer that the USB standard was so well adopted.</p>

and data exchanging abilities.</p>
                  <p>One of the main features applying to this is that technology will start keeping track of your personal data but also adapt to anticipate the information you will need based on your intentions.</p>
